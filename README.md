# www.aaronbarratt.dev
This is a simple static website to show myself off and highlight some of my personal projects and work history. Created using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), html and regular css. I wanted to keep it simple for my first time. 

I plan to refactor the site using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) now that I have an understanding of how to work with the basics.

Made with Python (Flask), HTML and CSS.

## Setup and Install
First make sure you have Python3 installed, including pip to install dependencies.

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/aarontbarratt/aaron-barratt-website.git`.
2. Navigate to the root directory `cd aaron-barratt-website/`.
    1. (Optional) I would highly recommend using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to install requirements and not make a mess of your base python install.
3. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run with python `python3 app.py`.
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser of choice.
